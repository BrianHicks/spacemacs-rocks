## Tips

For the most part, please use issues to contribute tips. I'll be recording all
of the screencasts to keep them consistent, so you don't need to bother with
that part, or getting them scheduled. To make things easier, here's a template:

    **Credit Me**: @you on GitHub (preferred. if you have your profile on GitHub
    filled out the site will automatically pull down your most current profile
    picture, name, and website) or @you on Twitter

    Your tip goes here. Please include installation instructions if it's beyond
    installing a layer in the standard distribution.

Just to emphasize: it looks much better on the site if I can credit you using
your GitHub information. Plus, if you change it the next build of the site (they
happen at least once every 24 hours) will pull in your new information, no PRs
required! It ends up looking something like this:

## Typos and Comments

If you see something wrong with a post, go ahead an open an issue. If you're
feeling frisky, you can submit a PR instead, but I may edit it (especially if
you don't give yourself credit for a content fix!)
