In the spacemacs startup screen there are a few useful key bindings:

- `tab` (`widget-forward`) - jump to next widget
- `backtab` (`widget-backward`) - jump to previous widget
- `r` - jump to first widget under `Recent files`
- `m` - jump to first widget under `Bookmarks`
- `p` - jump to first widget under `Projects`

The last three are extremely helpful. So for example, if you want to open the
second file in `Recent files` list you type `r <tab> <return>`.
