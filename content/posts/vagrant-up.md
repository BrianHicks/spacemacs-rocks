description: "hit `SPC V V` to run `vagrant up`"
title: "Start Vagrant"

If you need to run a Vagrant command quickly, check out the commands under `SPC
V`. They deal with most of the common commands needed when working with Vagrant
boxes, including tramp SSH. Demonstrated below: `vagrant-up` (`SPC V V`).

You need to have the vagrant layer installed for this to work (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/+tools/vagrant). Add `vagrant` to the existing `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` list in your `~/.spacemacs` file.
