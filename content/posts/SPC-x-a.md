Use the alignment shortcuts located under `SPC x a` to align based on a number
of different criteria (e.g. commas or pipes.) You can also use `align-repeat`
(`SPC x a r`) to align on an arbitrary character.

The screencast below demonstrates the difference between aligning on an
arbitrary character and aligning on one of the predefined characters. As you can
see, you can choose which behavior you want!
