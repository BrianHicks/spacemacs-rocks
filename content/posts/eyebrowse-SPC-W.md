If you're like me and work on a lot of projects withing one Emacs session, check
out
[eyebrowse](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/contrib/!window-management/eyebrowse).

The commands under `spacemacs/workspaces-micro-state` (`SPC W`, with the
eyebrowse layer installed):

 - any number: go to or create a workspace
 - `n` or `p` go forward or back one workspace
 - `c` closes the current workspace
 - `tab` switches to the last workspace used (and back)
 - `r` sets a label for the current workspace

Any other key exits the micro-state.
