You can quickly go to any variable in your `.spacemacs` by invoking
`helm-spacemacs` with `SPC f e h`. In the example below, we navigate to
`spacemacs-editing-style` by searching for "style". You can also use this tool
to navigate to the READMEs for any layer, the spacemacs documentation, and
toggle options.
