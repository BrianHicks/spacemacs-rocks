When you need to navigate around your filesystem quickly, hit `SPC a d` to open
a `dired` buffer in a given directory (you'll be able to specify it.) Once
you're in, hit `enter` to open a file or directory, and dthe normal movement
keys to navigate. You can hit `?` to get a list of other keybindings for doing
things like deleting, renaming, and copying files. A cool thing to note is that
if you rename a file using `dired`, the associated buffers open in emacs will
also be renamed.
